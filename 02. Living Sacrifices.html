<h1 align="left"><font face="Oswald SemiBold">Living Sacrifices: Embracing the Journey of Wholehearted 
Devotion</font></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">Moses felt a gentle tug within him, 
drawing him towards the tabernacle where the air seemed to hum with the presence 
of God. &quot;Moses,&quot; resonated the voice of the LORD, &quot;speak to the children of 
Israel.&quot; With a quickened heart, Moses nodded, embracing this divine charge.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">Approaching the assembled people, 
Moses relayed the LORD's message. &quot;When you approach the LORD,&quot; he began, 
gesturing for emphasis, &quot;bring offerings from your own flock or herd.&quot; His 
authoritative tone left no room for doubt. &quot;Choose a male without blemish for 
the ascending sacrifice,&quot; he instructed, emphasizing the importance of 
willingness. &quot;Present it willingly at the tabernacle entrance, before the 
dwelling of the LORD.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">The people listened intently, 
murmuring agreement, mingling with the rustle of fabric and shuffling of feet. 
In this sacred dialogue between man and God, actions spoke louder than words, 
each step a testament to their devotion. This approach, this ascent, reflected 
their dedication to seeking the presence of the Almighty.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">Within this narrative, the Hebrew 
terms &quot;Vayikra,&quot; &quot;qorban,&quot; and &quot;olah&quot; hold significant meaning. &quot;Vayikra,&quot; 
meaning &quot;And He called,&quot; symbolizes God's beckoning of Israel through Moses, a 
divine invitation to draw near. &quot;Qorban,&quot; derived from &quot;qarab,&quot; underscores the 
intimacy desired by God, emphasizing the closeness between the Creator and His 
people. Similarly, &quot;olah,&quot; referring to a &quot;burnt offering,&quot; symbolizes the 
offering's journey towards God's presence, a sacrificial act of devotion and 
surrender.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">Together, these terms paint a picture 
of God's desired relational dynamics, highlighting not only His call but also 
the manner in which we are to approach Him. Implicit within this narrative is 
the requirement of willingness. For the offering to be acceptable, it must be 
given freely and willingly, reflecting the heart's devotion to the Almighty.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">In essence, four principles emerge: 
being called by God, approaching Him with reverence, ascending to His throne 
through sacrificial devotion, and offering willingly and freely. This narrative 
echoes Paul's directive to &quot;present your bodies as a living sacrifice&quot; (Romans 
12:1), inspiring us to live out these principles in our daily lives.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Ubuntu" size="3">Offering Our Whole Selves to God: Paul's Call 
to Live Sacrificially</font></h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">When Paul exhorted believers to 
&quot;present your bodies as a living sacrifice&quot; (Romans 12:1), he was tapping into 
deep symbolic meaning from the Old Testament sacrificial system. His words 
carried echoes of the Hebrew terms &quot;qorban&quot; (offering) and &quot;olah&quot; (burnt 
offering) - sacrifices where an animal was wholly consumed by fire, representing 
complete dedication to God.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">For the ancient Israelites, these 
offerings embodied principles of humility, reverence, and trust as the worshiper 
approached the Lord. Every sacrifice was an act of contrition, obedience, and 
surrender of something precious to God. Paul cleverly employed this sacrificial 
imagery to instruct Christ's followers on the posture that should characterize 
our daily discipleship.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">Just as those Old Testament offerings 
were unreserved and total commitments, Paul called believers to a unreserved 
obedience and devotion of self. To be a &quot;living sacrifice&quot; means holding nothing 
back from God - our hopes, ambitions, desires, skills, and circumstances are ALL 
yielded up for His purposes. It requires an ongoing, wholehearted submission and 
trust in our loving Creator.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">This sacrificial living is 
fundamentally an issue of the heart. Like the dynamics of ancient Hebrew 
worship, it flows from an awe, reverence, and adoration for God's holiness. We 
aren't begrudgingly offering up our lives, but are compelled by amazement at the 
boundless worth of knowing Him. Out of that overflow, we joyfully hold nothing 
back.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">In essence, Paul was bridging the 
symbols of the old covenant with the realities of the new. The sacrificial 
system foreshadowed and prepared the way for a regenerated people completely 
devoted to God. Our lives, not the animals, become the fragrant offering to the 
Lord we worship and adore.&nbsp; Whether at church, work, or home, we are called to 
walk in daily surrender - letting His Spirit shape us into &quot;living&quot; displays of 
God's greatness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">Thematically, this message of 
complete devotion and sacrifice is also conveyed in the following biblical 
texts:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoListBullet2"><font face="Ubuntu">In the Old Testament, we see foreshadows of this type 
of wholehearted worship. The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) called God's people to 
love the Lord with all their heart, soul, and strength - holding nothing back in 
their devotion. The prophet Hosea 6:6 declares God's desire for steadfast love, 
not mere outward sacrifices.</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoListBullet2"><font face="Ubuntu">Likewise, the New Testament reinforces this posture. 
Jesus himself taught that the greatest commandments were to love God with one's 
entire being and to love one's neighbor (Matthew 22:37-39). The apostle Peter 
exhorted believers to be &quot;living stones&quot; being built up into a spiritual house 
for offering spiritual sacrifices (1 Peter 2:5).</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoListBullet2"><font face="Ubuntu">From Genesis to Revelation, we see God's heart for 
His people to live with single-minded allegiance and sacrificial abandon to Him. 
Just as the Old Testament system prepared the way, now we are called to 
continually &quot;present ourselves as living sacrifices&quot; (Romans 12:1) - set apart, 
holy instruments for His glory.</font></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Ubuntu">&nbsp;Our reasonable act of worship, 
therefore, is to hold nothing back, but freely yield our bodies, minds, and 
wills in service of the One who gave Himself fully for us. As we do, we become 
participators in God's grand story of redemption. (See also Psalm 51:17, Micah 
6:8, Hebrews 12:28-29, 1 Peter 2:5, Philippians 2:3-4, and Ephesians 5:2)</font></p>
<h3>Approaching God</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">At the core of this call to live as 
&quot;living sacrifices&quot; are foundational principles for how we are to approach and 
relate to God Himself. Humility, contrition, a desire to please Him, trust in 
His character, dependence on Him to meet our needs, and a continual searching 
and seeking for deeper relationship with Him - these are constants in our 
journey.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">These elements encompass the spirit 
of true repentance, which is central to sacrificial living. Repentance involves 
acknowledging our wrongdoing with humility and genuine remorse. But it goes 
beyond regret - repentance means reorienting our lives towards sincerely 
desiring to align with the teachings and will of Yeshua the Messiah.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">Repentance requires trusting in the 
character of God - believing in His mercy, grace, and readiness to forgive those 
who turn toward Him. It means recognizing our dependence on Yeshua's guidance, 
forgiveness and power to overcome our brokenness and live in righteousness. True 
repentance is actively seeking that deeper intimacy with our Lord through 
prayer, studying Scripture, and obeying His Word.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">This posture of continual repentance 
is at the heart of the &quot;living sacrifice.&quot; Just as the ancient offerings 
required inspection and preparation, so we must continually evaluate our lives, 
turning from sin and realigning our motives and actions to God's purposes. As we 
do, we are positioned to experience the ongoing renewal and transformation the 
Lord desires.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Ubuntu">Approaching the Holy One requires 
this lifestyle of repentance - humbly turning from our self-centered ways and 
surrendering to God's Lordship in every area of life. It is the path of 
wholehearted obedience and trust that allows us to draw near and become fully 
devoted and spent for His glory.</font></p>
<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Ubuntu">Repentance stands as the 
cornerstone of our relationship with God. It is a posture of humility and 
contrition before His holiness, coupled with an earnest desire to please and 
obey Him. Yet repentance is not merely a one-time act, but an ongoing journey of 
renewal - continually seeking the Lord, trusting in His loving character, and 
depending on Him to meet our needs. As we walk this path of repentance, we are 
ushered into deeper intimacy with our Heavenly Father. With open hands and 
contrite hearts, we become &quot;living sacrifices,&quot; wholly devoted instruments 
through which He can work and display His resplendent glory. It is a surrendered 
life of joyful obedience, experienced as we lean into the principles exemplified 
in the sacrificial system - humility, trust, seeking, and complete yielding to 
the One who is endlessly worthy </span>
